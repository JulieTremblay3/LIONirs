IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE N-WAY TOOLBOX ver. 2.10

There are some important details that are necessary to know in order
to be able to use the N-way toolbox properly. These are given here - please read
carefully before using the toolbox.


CONDITIONS
The toolbox is freeware and may be used (but not modified) if proper reference
is given to the authors. Preferably refer to

C. A. Andersson and R. Bro. The N-way Toolbox for MATLAB. 
Chemom.Intell.Lab.Syst. 52 (1):1-4, 2000.


or alternatively

WARRANTY
In short, no guarantees, whatsoever, are given for the quality
of this toolbox or for the consequences of its use. It is inevitable
that there will be some bugs, but we have tried to test the 
algorithms thoroughly.


WHERE DOES THE TOOLBOX WORK?
The toolbox has been tested on matlab 6.5 in Windows XP only. The toolbox 
uses features that are not compatible with matlab 4.x, so if you have matlab 4.x
you should use version 1.04 of this toolbox instead. 


SETTING UP THE TOOLBOX
In order to install the toolbox, simply (extract and) copy the files to a 
directory (e.g. NWAY). After copying all files, go to the 'update' homepage
in order to see if newer versions of individual files are available. Copy
these files indiviually overwriting the old files. Make sure that the updates
are copied after the main files. 

Make sure that the path ../nway is included in MATLAB's path. If you have e.g.
the PLS_toolbox, some files are named identically. This may cause problems 
depending on which functions you use. If you want to use e.g. the parafac 
function from the N-way toolbox, you have to ensure that either the path to 
the N-way toolbox appears before the path to the PLS_toolbox or that you run
matlab from the nway directory.

In order to get help on what files are present in the toolbox type 
<<help nway>> at the matlab command line (if nway is the name of the directory
where you have the files.


DATA INPUT
Unlike, older matlab 4 compatible versions of this toolbox, the data are input 
directly as multi-way arrays. Hence, there is no need for the DimX used earlier
for defining the size of the array. If you have a 10x8x100 array, X, that is 
held in a 10x(8*100) matrix, i.e. the old matrix format, you can convert to
a three-way array by

X = reshape(X,10,8,100);

This is the format in which the data must be input to the functions.


MODEL OUTPUT
Also the output has changed in most cases in version 2. With the use
of cell arrays, it is much easier to handle the output of a varying
number of component matrices. Let the components of a three-way parafac
model is held in a cell e.g. called Factors; e.g. arising from the call 
of a four-component model

Factors = parafac(X,3);

Then the first mode loadings are held in Factors{1}:

A = Factors{1};
B = Factors{2};
C = Factors{3};

For a Tucker model such as

[Factors,G]=tucker(X,[3 3 2]);

the components are found similarly and G will be a 3x3x2 array.

For a tri-PLS2 model (three-way X, two-way Y) two component sets are
defined

Xfactors - T=Xfactors{1}, Wj=Xfactors{2}, Wk = Xfactors{3}
Yfactors - U=Yfactors{1}, Q=Yfactors{2}

Instead of using the cell notation, it is possible to use the 
M-file FAC2LET (factors to letters) to extract components; e.g.

[A,B,C] = fac2let(Factors);


MISSING DATA
For all algorithms the same flag is used for missing elements, namely
NaN. If you have a data set, X, where missing elements are, e.g., 
designated by the number -9999, you can easily modify the data as

X(find(X==-9999))=NaN*find(X==-9999);


SUPPORT
We are VERY interested in and dependent on feedback from the users. If 
you have problems running the toolbox please supply screendumps as well as
version number of the toolbox, MATLAB, and operating system before contacting
us. We will do the utmost to help overcoming the problems. In the rare event
that the support required is very time-consuming we will have to charge for 
this service.
