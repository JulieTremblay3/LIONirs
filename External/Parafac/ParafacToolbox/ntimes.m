%NTIMES Array multiplication
%
% X*Y is the array/matrix product of X and Y. These are multiplied across the 
% modeX mode/dimension of X and modeY mode/dimension of Y. The number of levels of X in modeX
% must equal the number of levels in modeY of Y.
%
% The product will be an array of order two less than the sum of the orders of A and B
% and thus works as a straightforward extension of the matrix product. The order
% of the modes in the product are such that the X-modes come first and then the
% Y modes. 
%
% E.g. if X is IxJ and Y is KxL and I equals L, then 
% ntimes(X,Y,1,2) will yield a JxK matrix equivalent to the matrix product
% X'*Y'. If X is IxJxK and Y is LxMxNxO with J = N then 
% ntimes(X,Y,2,3) yields a product of size IxKxLxMxO
% 
%I/O: product = NTIMES(X,Y,modeX,modeY)
