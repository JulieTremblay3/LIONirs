% [E]=GSM(V);
% GS   Gram-Schmidt Method for orthogonalisation
%      An orthonormal basis spanning the columns of V is returned in E.
% 
%      This algorithm does not use pivoting or any other
%      stabilization scheme. For a completely safe orthogonalization
%      you should use 'ORTH()' though is may take triple the time.
%      'GSM()' is optimized for speed and requies only minimum storage
%      during iterations. No check of rank is performed on V!
