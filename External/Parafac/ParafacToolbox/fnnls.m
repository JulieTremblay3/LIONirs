%  FASTNNLS Fast non-negative least squares
%  The inputs are the matrix of predictor variables (x),
%  vector of predicted variable (y), and optional inputs
%  tolerance on the size of a regression coefficient that is
%  considered zero (tol), and initial guess for the regression
%  vector (b0). The output is the non-negatively constrained
%  least squares solution (b).
%
%  If tol is set to 0, the default tolerance will be used.
%  
%  FASTNNLS is fastest when a good estimate of the regression
%  vector is input. This eliminates much of the computation
%  involved in determining which coefficients will be nonzero
%  in the final regression vector. This makes it very useful
%  in alternating least squares routines. Note that the input
%  b0 must be a feasible (i.e. nonnegative) solution.
%
%  The FASTNNLS algorithm is based on the one developed by
%  Bro and de Jong, J. Chemometrics, Vol. 11, No. 5, 393-401, 1997
