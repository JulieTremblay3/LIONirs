%This algorithm takes a fluorescence landscape with
%excitation ranges and emission ranges defined by
%ExMin, ExMax, EmMin and EmMax. Given these specifications
%the algorithm identifies the Rayleigh-peak and replaces
%a certain number of neighboring wavelengths at each side
%of the peak with the 'Value' multiplied by
%the existing value in the range, - use NaN to set missing.
%
%Generally the peaks broaden as the excitation wavelength increase.
%The 'WidthMin' is the width of the Rayleigh peaks at the lowest
%excitation wavelength and 'WidthMax' is the peakwidth at the highest
%excitation wavelength. Giv also the width of the 2nd order Rayleigh
%peak of the first spectrum as 'Width2nd' since 2nd order scattering may be
%much wider than first order. The algorithm replaces up to and including
%scattering of 'MaxOrder' order starting from the 1st (no 0th order).
%'Mode'=1 uses the lowest emission wavelength as low limit, hence
%removing all emission wavelengths on the low side of the 0th order
%Rayleigh peak. 'Mode'=2 removes only the peak itself.
%
%The landscape is contained in the matrix X and each row in the matrix
%represents one emission spectrum. Hence, X has dimensions (a x b) where
%a is the number of excitation lines, and b is the number
%of measured emission wavelengths.
