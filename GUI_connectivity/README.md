## Description	
A **circular graph** is a visualization of a network of nodes and their connections. The nodes are laid out along a circle, and the connections are drawn within the circle. Click on a node to make the connections that emanate from it more visible or less visible. Click on the **Show All** button to make all nodes and their connections visible. Click on the **Hide All** button to make all nodes and their connections less visible.
