   <description>A 'circular graph' is a visualization of a network of nodes and their connections. The nodes are laid out along a circle, and the connections are drawn within the circle. Click on a node to make the connections that emanate from it more visible or less visible. Click on the 'Show All' button to make all nodes and their connections visible. Click on the 'Hide All' button to make all nodes and their connections less visible.</description>
